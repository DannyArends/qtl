This directory contains standalone binaries of R/qtl (currently MQM
implentations).

run:

  cd ./contrib/bin
  cmake .
	make 
	make test   
  (the binary is 'mqm').

To run regression testing from the default R interpreter:

  make testall

which builds and installs the 'qtl' package before running the
test scripts.
